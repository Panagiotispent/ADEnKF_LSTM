# PhD Research: LSTM and Auto-Differentiable Ensemble Kalman Filter

This repository contains the foundational code for conceptualizing the research conducted during my PhD, which integrates a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with the Auto-Differentiable Ensemble Kalman Filter ([AD-EKF](https://github.com/ymchen0/torchEnKF)).

The included scripts provide a basic implementation of the methods and models developed for this work. For detailed theoretical discussions, the exploration of multiple hypotheses, and in-depth results, please refer to the PhD thesis: {TO BE PUBLISHED}.
