# PhD Research: LSTM and Auto-Differentiable Ensemble Kalman Filter

This repository contains the foundational code for conceptualising the research conducted during my PhD, which integrates a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with the Auto-Differentiable Ensemble Kalman Filter ([AD-EKF](https://github.com/ymchen0/torchEnKF)).

The included scripts provide a basic implementation of the methods and models developed for this work. For detailed theoretical discussions, the exploration of multiple hypotheses, and in-depth results, please refer to the PhD thesis: {TO BE PUBLISHED} or contact the [author](panagiotispentaliotis@outlook.com).
The code includes extensive comments to illustrate the development process.

# **Note:**
- The `Filters_lstm_distributed.py` script serves as the main executable file for running the project.
- The script retains distributed code sections from earlier hypotheses, including functionality for distributed computations.
